# ar-ping-pong

The starter code for this project was forked from a CodeSandbox. Originally it is a simple "Keep Up" game with a paddle and ball controlled by mouse movements. I was interested in having the paddle controlled via an imported handtracking model.

## Status
In-Progress

I was able to load the handtracking model and succesfully detect a user's gestures. The game requires calibration to create a more fluid experience. I ran into some complications with mapping the model's X/Y/Z coordinates to the user's screen. Also noticed serious performance issues with spikes in FPS, hovering around 15 FPS. 

## Notes
My spring semester is underway so will have to revisit this once I have more time :)
